		"About_Us": "We have organized a new tournament trail that has a completely different tournament format than our area is used to. It will be exciting, fun, and profitable. Our flier/brochure pretty well spells out our format, but our intent is to have developed a trail that is affordable, but also set high enough, that with the right interest will have a good payout.<br><br>For example, 100 boats would pay out $7,000 for 1st, and pay a full 10 places. Big Bass will pay after the qualifying round no matter how big or small it is. (No carry over!) 200 boats will be a great payout, so spread the word!<br><br>The tournaments where we have done this format have been extremely exciting and fun!<br><br>We look forward to seeing you in January. Please call with any questions.<br><br>Just go Fishin'",
