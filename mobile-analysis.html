            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>For this assignment I was asked to exclusively use my phone for mobile browsing to see how well things work. I achieved this by browsing
more with my phone than I usually do, as well as occasionally browsing on an iPad mini.</p>
			<p>I feel like I completed this assignment fairly well. I'm not sure that I got a full 24 hours in using just my phone, but it was certainly
			an experience to use my phone more rather than finding something cool on my phone and then saving it for later to look at on my computer. It was 
			a challenge using my phone rather than my computer. I've an old phone and it loads websites very slow, and it's also a smaller screen than a lot of the
			new fancy phones out there that have larger screens.</p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Yes, actually. I never did run into a site where I couldn't view something that was available on the desktop version.</p>
			
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Usually. When sites have a menu bar with a lot of options inside, it can be tough sometimes to find the area you're looking for, like Facebook. For someone like me
			who doesn't normally use my phone for browsing because its quite slow (old phone mainly) Facebook is a challenge because I don't have a clue what the icons at the top 
			of the screen mean. There's no explination for what they each link to.</p>
			
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>Not really any problems here, unless I were to try to upload a file to DeviantArt. Since I don't store any artwork on my phone, I wouldn't be able to
			post from mobile. And on the subject of posting, that in itself can be annoying as typing on a touchscreen keyboard isn't the easiest, especially if it's
			a longer post.</p>
			
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>A few. Namely sites that have an app, and every time you visit them they ask if you want to download their app, with a full-screen
			popup that you have to confirm/deny to continue to the site. Namely <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit.com</a></p>
			<p>Also on Wikipedia, any page that has a table in it. Tables don't scale, so if it's a large one, like this one: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(full)">List of Latin phrases</a> It can be very annoying.</p>
			<p>And there's also the fact that a small touchscreen can be aggrivating, when you try to press one thing and end up navigating away from the page.</p>
			
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Do apps count? If so, then I prefer the Reddit app over using the mobile site. I even prefer the app over the desktop site, but that's just me.
			If apps don't count, then for the most part, no. Having to scroll horizontally to view all the elements in a table just doesn't work when you can't see
			the row/column you're in and you forget what the information pertainsn to. Sites without much content work fine on mobile, but anything with a lot going on
			usually isn't the best experience.</p>
			
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?</p>
			<p>I learned that mobile browsing is even more frustrating than I'd originally thought. No one likes waiting for a site to load, and with my slow phone, trying 
			to keep several tabs open at once just doesn't work. Since the tab has to reload each time you return to it, the loading times can get long if I'm trying to switch
			band and forth to reference something, or if I'm taking notes on my phone while brosing. There weren't really any suprprises, really. I pretty much got what I 
			expected out of it - that desktops/laptops are so much easier to work with, and phones should really only be used if you've no other option.</p>
            
            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases_(full)">List of Latin phrases</a>
				<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>
