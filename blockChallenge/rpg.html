                Ged sat in the tavern, his back to the entrance, silently nursing his drink and watching the
                other patrons. After a time of sitting in silence, he heard his name drifting toward him from one of
                the many conversations being held in the small bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                  - “’an ‘ol Ged, he’ll certainly take care of us iffin things go south tomorrow, won’t he? Eh
                Ged?”
            </p>
            <P>
                  Ged looked up from his mug, an amused look on his face. “You lot going hunting tomorrow, then?”
                he asked, shifting his chair to better face Gunther.
            </P>
            <p>
                  “Aye, we are,” Gunther said, grinning. “ I ’eard tell that a massive boar ‘as been sighted out
                by the crags. We ‘ope to bag ‘em on the morrow. I was just makin sure that you’d be here to put us back
                together should he get the better ‘o us, and all. Or if we run into that pack o goblins wanderin’
                around out there. Nasty buggers, them goblins.”
            </p>
            <p>
                  “Yes, I’ll be around tomorrow. It’s my day off at the temple, but if you need me, just send for
                Agda. She’ll be able to find me.” said Ged, raising his mug. “But here’s to not having to put you lot
                back together again!”
            </p>
            <p>
                  “Hear hear! I’ll drink to that!” Gunther’s table erupted into cheers. Ged smiled, and stood,
                grabbing his cloak hanging on the peg by the door. Putting on his cloak, he stepped into the doorway
                and raised his hand in farewell. “I’m turning in for the night. Hopefully I won’t see you lot
                tomorrow.” With that, he stepped into the cold night air, drawing his cloak closer around him and began
                the walk home.
