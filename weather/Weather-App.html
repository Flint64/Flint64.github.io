	<main>
	<h2 style = "color: #0066cc";>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The client would like a web based weather app created. The purpose of the site is to give<br>
		current weather conditions in 3 different ways. The initial landing page will give the weather<br> 
		for the current location based on the Geocoding information given by the browser. The second is <br>
		weather for 3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for<br>
		any location determined by a search string.</p>
	
	<h2 style = "color: #0066cc";>Audience</h2>
		<p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split<br>
		between mobile devices and laptops.</p>
	
	<h3 style = "color: #0066cc";>Audience Goals:</h3>
		<p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions<br>
		for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so<br>
		the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location is important as well.  The third goal <br>
		deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions for any location will help with last<br>
		minute packing for road trips.</p>

		<li><span class = "bold">Interests:</span> Traveling, seeing new things</li>
		
		<li><span class = "bold"> Motivation:</span> Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, whether<br>
		it is getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure,<br>
		has left him unprepared for weather conditions many times (He is tired of<br>
		sleeping in the rain and snow).  He would like to be more prepared...without<br>
		having to put much effort into it...or planning.</li>
	
		<li><span class = "bold">Environment:</span> Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will most<br>
		often be found on a smart phone however.  Many of the places he frequents do not have<br>
		great signal…he is often dealing with 3G speeds</li>

	<h2 style = "color: #0066cc";>Content</h2>
		<p>All weather pages should include Location name, temperature, high, low, current weather descriptor, precipitation,<br>
		and wind on small, and hourly temps should be added on larger screens. (See provided weather data file for more details)</p>
	
	<h3 style = "color: #0066cc";>Pages</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><span class = "bold">Home:</span> weather for the current location. Current location should be determined by using the Geolocation API of the browser. This information<br>
			  should be passed to the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" target = "_blank";>WeatherUnderground API </a> to retrieve the current conditions. </li>
			
			<li><span class = "bold">Franklin, Greenville, Springfield:</span> weather for each specific location. The weather for The Franklin and Greenville pages should be pulled from<br>
			a local JSON file that will be provided. </li>
			
			<li><span class = "bold">Search:</span> Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of suggested matches to appear.  Selected location will pull up the weather.<br>
			The search term from the field should be sent to the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=autocomplete-api&MR=1" target = "_blank";>WeatherUnderground autocomplete API</a>, and the results<br>
			used to pull the current conditions for the selected location.</li>
